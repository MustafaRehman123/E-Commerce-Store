# E-Commerce-Store
This is a demo project of Data structures and Algorithm's (DSA). Project name is E-Commerce store Build on Netbeans.
Introduction:
The E-commerce Online Store project leverages Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to develop a robust and efficient online shopping platform. This project encompasses designing a user-friendly interface, implementing efficient algorithms for data management, and ensuring secure transactions.
Objectives
•	Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface for shopping.
•	Provide a scalable and maintainable architecture.

Key Functions 
Product Storage:
o	Allows users to add products they wish to purchase.
o	Temporarily stores product information until the user is ready to proceed to checkout.
2.	Quantity Management:
o	Users can specify the quantity of each product they want to purchase.
o	Provides options to update quantities, add more items, or remove items from the cart.
3.	Price Calculation:
o	Automatically calculates the total cost of the items in the cart.
o	Updates the total price dynamically as items are added, removed, or their quantities are changed.
4.	User Session Management:
o	Maintains the state of the shopping cart across different pages of the website.
o	Ensures that the cart's contents persist even if the user navigates away from the page or logs back in at a later time.
5.	Checkout Process:
o	Facilitates the transition from browsing to purchasing by leading the user through the checkout process.
o	Collects necessary information such as shipping address, payment details, and billing information.
6.	Discounts and Promotions:
o	Applies any available discounts, coupons, or promotional offers to the cart.
o	Displays the adjusted total price after applying discounts.

System Architecture
The E-commerce Online Store is structured using a multi-tier architecture:
1.	Presentation Layer: The front-end, developed using Netbeans GUI and Java, provides an interactive user interface for browsing products, adding items to the cart, and checking out.
2.	Data Layer: This layer uses a MySQL database to store user data, product information, and order details.

•	Authorization: Role-based access control for different user roles (admin and customer).
•	Data Validation: Preventive measures against SQL injection and other common attacks.
Testing and Validation
•	Unit Testing: Testing individual components to ensure they work correctly.
•	Integration Testing: Ensuring different modules interact seamlessly.
Challenges and Solutions
1.	Scalability:
o	Implemented database indexing and load balancing to handle increased data and user traffic.
2.	Security:
o	Regular security updates and audits to protect against vulnerabilities.
3.	Performance Optimization:
o	Caching frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
o	Optimizing algorithms to reduce execution time.
